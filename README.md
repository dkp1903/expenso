Welcome! Expenso is a voice powered budget tracking app created using React, Material UI and Speechify that allows you to add income and expenses across a variety of categories.

The data persists in local storage, and thus, you don't need to worry about authentication or data privacy. It's only limited to your browser.

### How to run the app?

Go to https://expenso.netlify.app. You'll be prompted by the browser to allow microphone access. Click and hold the icon until it changes from a power icon to a mic icon. Once that is done, you're all set to record your transaction. Make sure there's a halo around the icon when you're recording - which shows that the app is listening.Use the format as given in the app itself to record a transaction.

A video walkthrough of the app can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/e0c12ce6262b434db4ad8be643537e95)
