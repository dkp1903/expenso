### Expenso

## [View the live deployment here](https://expenso.netlify.app)

Welcome! Expenso is a voice powered budget tracking app created using React, Material UI and Speechify that allows you to add income and expenses across a variety of categories.

The data persists in local storage, and thus, you don't need to worry about authentication or data privacy. It's only limited to your browser.

### How to run the app?

Go to https://expenso.netlify.app. Click and hold the recording icon until you can see a halo around it. It might take a couple of tries before you see it, because of browser issues. Once that halo is visible, you're all set to run your app. Use the format as given in the app itself to record a transaction.

A video walkthrough of the app can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/e0c12ce6262b434db4ad8be643537e95)
